# EpicGameCollector

EpicGameCollector is an automation tool designed to streamline the collection of the weekly free game available on the Epic Games platform.

# Motivation

This project serves a dual purpose.

1.Firstly, it is a practical application of UiPath, providing a hands-on introduction to this powerful robotic process automation platform. 

2. Secondly, it addresses a personal need. As an enthusiastic gamer, I value the free games offered by Epic Games. However, due to a busy schedule, I often forget to claim these games within the offer period. By building this robot, I ensure that I never miss these opportunities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you meet the following requirements:

* You have the latest version of Microsoft Edge installed.
* You have installed the UiPath extension for Microsoft Edge.
* UiPath Studio is installed on your machine.
* UiPath Orchestrator is set up to schedule the program to run weekly. It is recommended to schedule it for the last days of the week.
